Open VirtualBox

Right-click your VM, then click Settings

Go to Shared Folders section

Add a new shared folder

On Add Share prompt, select the Folder Path in your host that you want to be accessible inside your VM.

In the Folder Name field, type shared

Uncheck Read-only and Auto-mount, and check Make Permanent

Start your VM

Once your VM is up and running, go to Devices menu -> Insert Guest Additions CD image menu

Use the following command to mount the CD:

sudo mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom
Install dependencies for VirtualBox guest additions:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-`uname -r`
Run installation script for the guest additions:
sudo /media/cdrom/./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
Reboot VM
sudo shutdown -r now
Create "shared" directory in your home
mkdir ~/shared
Mount the shared folder from the host to your ~/shared directory
sudo mount -t vboxsf shared ~/shared
The host folder should now be accessible inside the VM.
cd ~/shared
